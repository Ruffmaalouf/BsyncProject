3- Dependency injection is a crucial concept in .NET Core development as it helps promote code maintainability, testability, and flexibility. Here's how dependency injection was used  effectively in the project:
1. Register Services:

In the application's Startup.cs, i  register my services using the ConfigureServices method. For example:

public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IUserService, UserService>();
    services.AddTransient<IAccountService, AccountService>();
    services.AddTransient<ITransactionService, TransactionService>();
    // Register other services
}
This registers services and their corresponding interfaces. By using AddTransient, a new instance of the service is created every time it's requested.

2. Use Constructor Injection:

In  controllers, business logic classes, or any other classes that need access to these services, use constructor injection:

public class UserController : Controller
{
    private readonly IUserService _userService;

    public UserController(IUserService userService)
    {
        _userService = userService;
    }

    // Controller actions that use _userService
}
Constructor injection is the most common and recommended way to inject dependencies.

3. Benefits of Dependency Injection:

Testability: By injecting dependencies, you can easily replace real services with mock or stub implementations during unit testing. This ensures that your tests are isolated and not dependent on external systems.

Please note that i didnt have enough time to implement unit testing and mock services.


in order to make this api work , please set the connection string in the appsettings file in order to connect to the DB.
